This project involves analyzing a dataset from ABC Company containing information about 458 employees across various teams. The main tasks include preprocessing the data, analyzing employee distribution, and generating insights based on team allocations, positions, salary expenditures, and age demographics. Key preprocessing steps involve correcting missing values in the "height" column by replacing them with random values between 150 and 180, ensuring data consistency. The analysis includes determining the distribution of employees across teams, identifying predominant age groups, and discovering which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. Additionally, a correlation between age and salary is examined to uncover potential trends.

Graphical representations, such as bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, are used to present the findings clearly and effectively. Insights from the analysis include identifying overstaffed or understaffed teams, understanding the company's workforce demographics, and discovering relationships between employee age and salary. These insights provide valuable information for optimizing team structures, budgeting, and compensation strategies within the organization. The project not only demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation and analysis but also in presenting findings visually to aid decision-making.
